The Bakery Management System is a Windows Forms application specifically developed for managing the operations of a bakery in the field of E-commerce. This system is created using the C# programming language within a Windows Forms application and is linked to an MSSQL database. It provides a comprehensive solution for effectively overseeing the day-to-day activities of a bakery and enhancing overall consumer satisfaction.

The application enables consumers to explore and purchase a wide range of bakery items, including cakes and pastries. Afterward, customers can proceed to the checkout process, during which the system automatically calculates the entire cost of their order.

From an admin side, the system offers a user interface for overseeing and controlling the bakery's product catalog. Administrators can effortlessly incorporate new products, modify current ones, and manage inventory, guaranteeing customers consistently have the opportunity to get the most recent offerings from the bakery.

The primary objective of this system is to ease the ordering process for consumers while simultaneously offering an effective tool for bakery management.
